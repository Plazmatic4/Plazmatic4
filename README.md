- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Plazmatic4 Or Jess if you prefer
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Game Development and all things to do with such. Including Writting, Programing, and Model Making. 
  With these three aspect I try to aproach like a computerscientist and figure out how to optimize them in different aspects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently refining my knowledge on Big-O notation as it is a highly useful skill and I was not able to take more courses on it during school.
